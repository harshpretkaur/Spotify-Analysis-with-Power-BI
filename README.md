## ðŸ›  How It Was Created

1. **Data Import & Cleaning**  
   - Brought raw data into Power BI Desktop.  
   - Used Power Query Editor to clean, remove duplicates, and format columns.  

2. **Data Modeling**  
   - Defined relationships between tables.  
   - Created calculated columns and measures using DAX (e.g., totals, averages, KPIs).  

3. **Dashboard Design**  
   - Built multiple visuals: charts, slicers, and tables.  
   - Applied themes, formatting, and filters for better usability.  

4. **Interactivity**  
   - Added slicers and filters for user-driven insights.  
   - Ensured visuals update dynamically when filters are applied.
